# Streamlit

As you probably already learned, **Streamlit** is one of the best tools to help you make your projects, based on machine learning models, more attractive and interactive. For this task, we encourage you to use online documentation when needed because thatâ€™s the best way to understand all the tools this framework provides.

## Selected Dataset

Wine Quality Data Set. Available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset).

## Tasks

For this chapter, you will have to do the following:

- Create a home page with the description of the dataset you choose
- Add a sidebar where you will be able to switch between the created pages
- On the next page, add multiple input value widgets that will be used to change the parameters of your model
- Add a data display element that will print the current head of the dataset
- After changing the parameters, add a process button that will be used to start training a new model with the input parameters given.
- Add a container in which will be written all the parameters you set
- Below the container, add at least 3 charts that will print the correlation between the columns or the prediction for categories and others
- For each text element, use a different type (i.e. markdown, code block, title, header, LaTeX)
