# Logistic Regression

In the previous topic, you learned about regression tasks in the Machine Learning field. Classification is another popular type of task in Machine Learning, where instead of learning to predict a continuous value, you learn the predict the discrete ones. The first type of classification model that you will learn will be the LogisticRegression, which uses linear regression as a base model and adapts it to classification tasks.

In this task, we invite you to train 2 models on the selected Data Set that should predict the target column. The models are the following:

- the LogisticRegression from sklearn;
- the Log_reg implementation offered in SMLH.

## Selected Data Set

Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Available [here](https://bit.ly/3TR0yYU).

## Tasks

- Create a Jupyter notebook with a clean code.
- If your classes are expressed as non-numerical features, map them to numbers, for example, 0, 1, 2, etc.
- Study the correlation between features, find the features subset with the highest correlation with the target column, and try to explain from the business point of view why they have such a big correlation.
- Create a second set of data with the columns that have an absolute correlation between 0.5 and 0.8 with the target column.
- Split the data into 2 sub-sets using the train test split function from sklearn.
- Train a sklearn Logistic Regression model on the data provided to you.
- Train a from-scratch implementation of Logistic Regression on the train sub-set.
- Test the models on the test sets from the initial data set. For the error metric, use the accuracy score function from sklearn.metrics.
- Split the data with the selected columns into 2 sub-sets using the train test split function from sklearn.
- Train a sklearn Logistic Regression model on the data with selected columns (train subset).
- Train a from-scratch implementation of Logistic Regression on the train sub-set.
- Test the models on the test sets from the initial data set. For the error metric, use the accuracy score function from sklearn.metrics.
- Please try to interpret the results you are getting by comparing the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test sets.
- Please comment on your code.
