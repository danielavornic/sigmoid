# Memory optimization. Dask

The process of training a model can be challenging and both computation and memory intensive. **Dask** is one of the solutions to handle the issue of memory limitations in the case of working with a large amount of data.

## Selected Dataset

Spanish Rail Tickets Pricing â€“ Renfe Data Set. Available [here](https://bit.ly/3Sah9pN).

## Tasks

For this chapter, you will have to do the following:

- Import one of the datasets above as a Dask object and set the number of partitions;
- Prepare the dataset for further processing;
- Output the head of the current data and the description for each remained column;
- Select a criteria to group the data by and output the significant data for each group;
- Choose a suitable algorithm from the ones studied earlier and apply it to the analyzed dataset;
- Plot some significant data using Dask.
