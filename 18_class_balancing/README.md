# Class Balancing

In Machine Learning, **Class Balancing** means balancing a Data Set where number of classes are unbalanced. Avoiding Class Imbalance is essential before using a machine learning algorithm because our end goal is to train a machine learning model that generalizes well for all possible classes assuming we have a binary dataset with an equal number of samples.

## Data Set

Pokemon Classification Data Set. Available [here](https://bit.ly/3sJpeqn).

## Tasks

For this chapter, you will have to do the following:

- Using Class Balancing, try the algorithms you discovered and apply them to the proposed Data Sets.
