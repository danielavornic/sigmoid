# Sigmoid Initiation Task

This repository contains the work files of the initiation task required for the Sigmoid ML mentorship program.

## Steps

You will have to work with the Titanic Dataset that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

You will have to download the .csv files and work with them. This are some main steps that should be done in your work, but feel free to add anything else that you think is needed.

1. Try to understand the problem that you have to solve and make some assumptions and analysis based on the data that you have;
2. According to the task, clean the data and extract the most out of it;
3. Create a model, train it on train data and make predictions for test data;
4. Check if your initial assumption relate to the results you got and make some conclusions;
5. Present your work in a jupyter notebook with proper comments and markdown paragraphs of your ideas/assumptions/conclusions.
