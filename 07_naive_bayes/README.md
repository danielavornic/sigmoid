# Probability. Naive Bayes.

In this task, you are going to explore the next Classification Machine Learning Algorithm - **Naive Bayes**. There are actually more than one type of this algorithms, so you will get to test three of them. Naive Bayes is a ML model that is used for data of large volumes. One of the recommended algorithms used in these scenarios.

## Selected Data Set

Telco Customer Churn Data Set. Available [here](https://bit.ly/3fqDwc7).

## Tasks

For this chapter, you will have to do the following:

- Load the selected Data Set.
- Split the data set into the train and test set.
- Analyze and Preprocess your data.
- Create an instance of [Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://bit.ly/3DTv0fu).
- Create an instance of [Multinomial Naive Bayes](https://bit.ly/3sOP4Jn).
- Create an instance of [Bernoulli Naive Bayes](https://bit.ly/3WkuC0t).
- Train every version of Naive Bayes on the train data set and make predictions on the corresponding test subsets.
- Get the accuracy of model.
- Create a table of the following structure as a pandas data frame.

| ML Model | Accuracy |
| -------- | -------- |
| â€Ž        |          |

- Make a conclusion based on the data frame that you got.
